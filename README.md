# Behavior Analysis with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for analyzing and classifying behavioral data using machine learning and deep learning models. The project demonstrates the application of a **Random Forest Classifier** and a **Neural Network** to classify individuals into behavioral groups based on the provided dataset.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and standardizes the dataset, handling missing values and categorical transformations.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements a Random Forest Classifier for group classification.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes a Neural Network model with Keras for advanced classification.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and AUC-ROC curves for performance analysis.
- **Visualization**: Includes training history plots and AUC-ROC curves for interpretability.
